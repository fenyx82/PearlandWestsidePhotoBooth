# PearlandWestsidePhotoBooth
Raspberry Pi powered photobooth that uses an SNES USB controller and uploads images to Twitter.

I created this program to use at the Houston Maker Faire in 2017.  It uses a USB SNES controller to run the program.  There are plenty of other projects out there that use physical buttons.  I wanted something portable and easy to take apart, so I went with a USB controller that I had already.

I used the information from https://videos.cctvcamerapros.com/raspberry-pi/twitter-api-project-camera-tweet-photo.html to set up the Twitter posting feature.  I took out all my Twitter info,  when using the code insert your keys between the single quotation marks.

And I used this site http://ericgoebelbecker.com/2015/06/raspberry-pi-and-gamepad-programming-part-1-reading-the-device/ to get the code for using the SNES controller.
