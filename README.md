# PearlandWestsidePhotoBooth
Raspberry Pi powered photobooth that uses an SNES USB controller and uploads images to Twitter.

Created this program to use at the Houston Maker Faire in 2017.  It uses a USB SNES controller to run the program.  They are plenty of other projects out there that use physical buttons.  I wanted something portable and easy to take apart, so I went with a USB controller that I had laying around.
